
University of Windsor's Odette Product Management Club Website.

Taking inspiration from HTML5's website layout and my designer's (Pranjal Prakash) inputs, I've developed this website in order to establish the Odette Product Management Club's online presence.
This website also allows club member and/or interested students a space to explore what the club is all about, get connected to the club's various social media accounts and messaging platforms, look up and sign up for the club's sessions and events, connect with the club members, as well as ask us any doubts or concerns that may arise - all found in the website!
With most clubs at the University of Windsor having club pages that are either facebook pages or other social media pages, we at the Odette Product Management Club wanted to have our very own website that showcases the technological talent that we possess.
I believe that first impressions can go a long way in terms of the club's outreach / marketing, so why not create a cool and unique website that is personalized to the club?


Installation and Running:

Because the website has google analytics installation code as well as hubspot's API calls, simply downloading the files and running the index file will cause the website to load infinitely.
I host the website on 000webhostapp.com, which makes the website load and run.

In order to install and run this on your local device:
1. Download the files from the repository
2. Modify the index.html file by deleting the code in the Google Tag comment chunk in the head section as well as the beginning of the body section (there should be two code chunks that you delete in total)
3. Save the file and open the file on your browser. (the only thing it will be missing when compared to the live online website is the hubspot chatbox on the bottom left corner, since this calls for the website to be published)


The best way to take a look at the full website is by viewing it online: https://odettepmclub.000webhostapp.com/
